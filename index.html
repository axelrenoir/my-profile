		<p>
			I am a <strong>Business School Student</strong> and I am passionate about football and music. I would like to do my third year internship in a company that will prepare me as much as possible for my carreer.
	</p> 

<h2>Business School Student</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree with a <strong>Entrepreneurship Major</strong> at Audencia Business School in Nantes.
	</p>

	<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
	<p>I chose this specific Major because I would like to develop my own business and be independant.
